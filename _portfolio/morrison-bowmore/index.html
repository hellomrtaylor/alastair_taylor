  <p>Alastair was tasked with creating a clean and modern website that portrayed the company’s modern image. The design was to be flexible enough to adopt an upcoming company rebrand, whilst accommodating the current identity in the interim. The project involved working with a group of stakeholders ranging from production operators to the company’s CEO and board of directors to ensure the site addressed the entire company’s needs.</p>
