  <p class="lemme-introduce-myself">A rebuild of the car search function of Arnold Clarkâ€™s flagship website, the priority on this project was reducing technical debt. However there were opportunities to improve UX throughout the website, in particular on smaller screens. As Senior UX designer I lead the design team who all contributed to this large project. One of our main challenges was justifying UX improvements on a mainly technical project, which we did using analytics data and in-house usability testing.</p>
