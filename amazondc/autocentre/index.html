  <h1 class="a-big-project">AutoCentre</h1>
  <p class="lemme-introduce-myself">AutoCentre is ACVMâ€™s fleet and driver management tool aimed at businesses managing large scale fleets. As sole designer on the AutoCentre team I faced many challenges including conflicting stakeholder priorities, and finding simple ways to display large amounts of complex data. Conducting usability tests with real customers proved powerful when it came to simplifying workflows and satisfying business stakeholders.</p>
