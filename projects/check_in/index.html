  <p class="type_featured">I created a digital hotel check in experience that allowed guests to get to the fun faster and for managers to optimise their business. I led research and design until the concept’s MVP launched.</p>

  <h3 class="type_display_3 article_heading">Research</h3>
  <h2 class="type_display_2">Leaning on existing research and personal experiences, a design sprint helped us generate possible avenues to improve guest's experience</h2>
  <p class="type_body">This project started with a simple question; “How can we enable our hotel partners to provide guests with a seamless, personalised and delightful travel experience?” We gathered existing research from around the business and kicked off an inception sprint with a team of designers, copywriters and product managers. We invited experts from the business including customer service executives and local partners experts to help us understand guests’ problems.</p>

    <figcaption class="article_image_caption type_caption">A discussion during our kick off sprint</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="type_body">From our user journey we highlighted 3 main pain points and brainstormed opportunities to improve guests experiences. At this critical moment we brought in senior management stakeholders to help us identify which opportunity would have the backing of the business. At the end of our sprint, we’d identified the hotel check-in experience as a point of friction that we could transform through technology.</p>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">After identifying check-in as our focus point, we dove deeper and talked to guests to help us understand what was and wasn’t valuable to them</h2>
  <p class="type_body">We wanted to understand both the human side and the scale of the problem. I created a discussion guide and we ran guerilla research to talk to guests who were currently on their travels in Amsterdam about their check-in experiences. I shadowed reception at a local hotel and checked in guests on a busy Friday. We mined Booking.com public guest reviews for clues. Our insights were broad.</p>

    <figcaption class="article_image_caption type_caption">A spreadsheet that a local hotel used to manage guest check-ins</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="type_body">We started to understand what was a basic need and what things added delight to the experience. We could also see the size of the problem; almost two thirds of check-in negative reviews related to unexpected waiting times upon arrival. With the help of our UX researcher we ran a multi-country survey to size the findings of our research and level out any bias from our rough and ready interviews.</p>

  <p class="type_body">Whilst guests wanted to feel welcomed at a property, if they didn’t get the information they needed about the local area or hotel facilities, it wasn't of much value. And while guests wanted to make sure any extra requests were fulfilled at check-in, it wasn’t valuable unless they could actually get into their room. With these results in hand, we needed a way to visualise the different needs of our guests at check-in. Inspired by Mazlov’s hierarchy of needs, I created a check-in hierarchy to reflect the importance of different aspects.</p>

  <h3 class="type_display_3 article_heading">Ideation &amp; Design</h3>
  <h2 class="type_display_2">Our research showed that getting the guests to the room as fast as possible would create a solid foundation we could build upon with extra value features</h2>
  <p class="type_body">To find the best experience we dogfooded check-in experiences at hotels with a high review score. We identified the flows and features that really made a difference. I ran a workshop with the team and stakeholders, brainstorming and exploring the fastest ways we could test our hypothesis.</p>
  <p class="type_body">Next we built a simple prototype and conducted remote tests with users to test our concepts. We offered a range of check-in features; digital room keys, local guides, luggage delivery and early room access. Some features, like luggage delivery didn’t receive the delight we expected, whilst users seemed universally excited about the ability to skip the queue at check-in and use their phone to access their room.</p>

  <h3 class="type_display_3 article_heading">Testing &amp; Iteration</h3>
  <h2 class="type_display_2">A dry run of our concept with real guests helped us understand the details of the process and gather feedback</h2>
  <p class="type_body">While we had a concept guests were excited to use, scaling out this solution could be much harder. Checking in a guest to a hotel Property Management System and issuing a key would mean integrating with hundreds of solutions in a fragmented market of software. Scaling a solution like that could take years of effort. We decided instead to work with 3rd party solutions who had already done the hard work of integrating with hotel software.</p>
  <p class="type_body">But before a full scale launch, we wanted to test the real experience, not just the digital one. After all these were real guests starting real holidays. The last thing we wanted to do was make this worse. We partnered with an independent hotel in Hamburg, Germany that was already offering digital check-in to guests who booked directly via their app. Our test would open that up to include a small number of Booking.com guests via a mobile experience I’d designed.</p>

    <figcaption class="article_image_caption type_caption">Our first test used by real users</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="type_body">We launched our test and asked guests to give feedback and interviewed those who volunteered for a follow up. On the whole the experience was positive, but guests highlighted areas we had missed. What to do if your phone was lost or ran out of battery, or how to easily contact reception if you couldn’t get the door to open without having to walk all the way down and back. I updated our designs and developers got to work on implementing it.</p>

  <p class="type_body">Whilst I moved on from the project check-in continues to be a feature being worked on today at Booking.com.</p>
