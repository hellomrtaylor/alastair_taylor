  <h1 class="type_display_1 article_title">Helping Booking.com's independent hotel partners find the right software to manage their business</h1>
  <p class="type_featured">After spending time with partners, we discovered why many weren't benefitting from what modern hospitality software had to offer. We created a personalised hospitality app store with direct integrations to help partners find and set up software with ease. I led research and design on this project from inception until it's scaled launch at ITB Berlin.</p>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">Interviews at properties revealed the challenges of running an independent hotel and the problems with adopting software.</h2>
  <p class="type_body">We kicked off this project with visits to some of Booking.com's hotel partners in Florence, Italy. I had created a discussion guide based on some of our existing knowledge to help us learn how we could make running their businesses easier and more efficient. Accompanied by a Product Manager, and Product Marketing Manager I ran interviews with hoteliers about the everyday running of their properties. These were busy people - our interviews would be routinely interrupted by new guests arriving, deliveries or phone calls as these managers juggled everyday tasks.</p>
  <p class="type_body">Many were relying on old, out-dated software, or pen and paper solutions to keep track of guest bookings, requests, maintenance and staff timetables. Those who had made the move to more modern software had struggled with the experience. We knew software existed in the world that would solve these problems. What we discovered would form the basis of a new project at Booking.com</p>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">To help communicate and document the problem, we created a user journey map of a hotelier’s software buying journey.</h2>
  <p class="type_body">We took our interview notes, referring back as much as we could to real life examples and created a journey map of how our partners purchased software. It didn't take us long to pinpoint the problems. We boiled down the problems to 3 key areas.</p>

  <ol class="type_list">
    <li class="type_list_item">Google results would usually show software aimed at large scale properties and chains like Hilton or Marriott. Software made for small, independent properties was harder to find.</li>
    <li class="type_list_item">Comparing solutions was tricky. Pricing was rarely transparent and demos almost always required a long call with a sales person. We tried it for ourselves, just getting to use a UI could take weeks of calls and meetings. We spoke to one partner who had been evaluating different solutions for a year.</li>
    <li class="type_list_item">Setting up software to work with your existing bookings sometimes required manually importing them, a process that could take weeks. Some providers would charge thousands of euros to integrate with any other software you used.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">With a solid understanding of the problem, I ran a design sprint with the entire team to explore how we could solve it</h2>
  <p class="type_body">Loosely following the GV design sprint format, we brought the entire team of developers, product managers and copywriters who would be working on the project to create a solution together. We made sure everyone had a solid understanding of the problem, presenting our findings from our research and bringing in experts from the hotel side of the Booking.com business.</p>

  <p class="type_body">We distilled our problems down to "How Might We" notes and got busy brainstorming and sketching solutions. At key moments we'd bring in leadership to make sure they were bought into our solutions too. At the end of the week we'd come up with a solution we thought had promise. An app store of hospitality software which we hoped would solve our hotelier's problems.</p>
  <p class="type_body">Our store would be customised based on what Booking.com already knew about your hotel - its size, location, occupancy rate, guest type to show the most relevant results. Every solution would be quality and security checked so you could trust what you were seeing.</p>
  <p class="type_body">Each app would have a listing, structured in the same way, with transparent pricing. With a couple of clicks, you could launch a 30 day free trial to try out any software for themselves.</p>
  <p class="type_body">We would work with each software provider to ensure hoteliers could instantly import their Booking.com reservations and all of the software from the store work side by side, by default.</p>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">Testing with partners revealed our store concept had promise, along with some details to improve upon.</h2>
  <p class="type_body">At the end of the week we ran remote tests with hoteliers in our target market. Working with our copywriter I'd built a prototype of the store, adding information from the websites of real software providers. We got mixed results.</p>
  <p class="type_body">A large number of users liked the concept, but repeatedly said that the software we had shown wasn't suited to their property. Clearly we had some more work to do with our selection of apps.</p>
  <p class="type_body">What's more they didn't think there was enough information on each product to make a decision to purchase the software. We had assumed that a short summary would be enough, and the trial would explain everything else. The free trial was great, but it still required too much time investment to understand everything a product had to offer.</p>
  <p class="type_body">The "ah-ha" moment came when we asked users to proceed through the prototype and start a trial. They were confused when they landed in the software dashboard, read to use. "Where do I enter all my information?" - we explained that it would all happen automatically and would be more or less instant. The penny finally dropped when our participants realised just how easy it would be to set up new software. While we realised we had a lot of work to do, there was clearly promise in the concept.</p>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">With a solid concept we got down to work building our ambitious app store and improving on areas areas our participants had highlighted</h2>
  <p class="type_body">The first job was to understand exactly what shape our MVP would take. Did we need that predictive search feature, or complex content management system to prove our product? I ran an MVP prioritisation session, working closely with our Product Manager, developers and stakeholders to decide what was critical, and what could wait until later. We made some tough decisions but the core of the concept was still there.</p>
  <p class="type_body">As the developers got down to build the foundations, I started to work on the problems that had been highlighted in our usability tests.</p>
  <p class="type_body">Participants had reported that the apps didn't seem to suit their business in our prototype. Whilst what we showed them was a static prototype and wasn't as smart as our final product would be and our business development team were fast at work tracking down software better suited to our target market, we knew we still could make improvements. The photography in our prototype showed a large hotel reception - something our independent hotels, inns and B&amp;Bs couldn't relate to. I created a series of illustrations that would match our hotelier’s property. Small copy changes helped too. "Software suited to your business" became "Apps for independent hotels", "Up-sell software" became "Get more from your guests" adjusting dynamically to the users property specs and language that our participants used.</p>

    <figcaption class="article_image_caption type_caption">A collection of custom illustrations I created for the project</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="type_body">The other problem we'd seen in our tests was that users didn't think they had enough information to make a call to decide if this software was right from them. We worked with both our hotel partners and software providers to identify what this was. We created a templated layout where we gave a high level app summary, product demo videos, and in depth feature information. I worked with our copywriter to develop a content and style guide for software providers to best translate their products into language our target user would understand.</p>

  </figure>
  <p class="type_body">Finally we slowed down our setup process from around a second to around 15 seconds. We used the extra time to explain what was happening in the background. Whilst it would take our users a few seconds longer to get into the app, our tests showed it helped them understand what was going on, and landing in the app made much more sense to them.</p>

  <p class="type_body">After a soft launch to a small set of users went well, we quickly scaled and launched publicly at ITB Berlin, Europe's largest travel trade show. We quickly had thousands of hotels visiting our App Store and signing up for products. The team at the event reported users delight at how easy it was to find and try software for their business.</p>
