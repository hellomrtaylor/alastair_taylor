  <h1 class="type_display_1 article_title">Helping Booking.com's independent hotel partners find the right software to manage their business</h1>
  <p class="type_featured">BookingSuite’s App Store is a personalised hospitality app store which helps independent accommodation find, compare and try software. I led research and design on this project from inception until it's scaled launch at ITB Berlin.</p>

  <h3 class="type_display_3 article_heading">Research</h3>
  <h2 class="type_display_2">Interviews at properties revealed the challenges of running an independent hotel and the problems with adopting software.</h2>
  <p class="type_body">I kicked off this project by interviewing some of Booking.com's accommodation partners in Florence, Italy. I created a discussion guide which helped us learn how we could make running their businesses easier and more efficient.</p>
  <p class="type_body">To document our findings, we created a user journey map, referring back as much as we could to real life examples from the managers we had spoken to. It didn't take us long to pinpoint the main problems.</p>

  <p class="type_body">Accommodation managers struggled to find appropriate software so much that many were still using pen and paper to organise their operations. Search engines showed inappropriate software aimed at larger chain properties. What's more, comparing pricing and getting demos required long calls with sales people. Finally, we found setting up software required manually importing reservations, a process that could take weeks or cost thousands of euros.</p>

  
  <h3 class="type_display_3 article_heading">Ideation &amp; Design</h3>
  <h2 class="type_display_2">With a solid understanding of the problem, I ran a design sprint and tested our concept with hoteliers</h2>

    <figcaption class="article_image_caption type_caption">Updated user journey map at our design sprint</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="type_body">I planned and facilitated a design sprint bringing in the team of developers, product managers and copywriters who would be working on the project.</p>

  <p class="type_body">We brought our research findings, journey map and outside experts’ knowledge and transformed it into "How Might We" notes to group our insights. Once we’d started brainstorming and sketching solutions we invited leadership stakeholders to make sure they were bought in too. At the end of the week we'd come up with a solution we thought had promise; An app store of personalised software recommendations with transparent features and pricing. With a couple of clicks, you could launch a 30 day free trial to try out any software for themselves.</p>
  
  
  <h3 class="type_display_3 article_heading">Testing &amp; Iteration</h3>
  <h2 class="type_display_2">Hoteliers revealed our store concept had promise, along with some details to improve upon</h2>
  <p class="type_body">Hoteliers loved the concept, but said that the software we had shown wasn't suited to their property. What we’d shown them wasn't as smart as our final product would be but we made sure to show better suited apps in our follow up test. I replaced photography of large hotel receptions, something our independent hotels and b&amp;bs couldn't relate to, with illustrations that would match our hoteliers’ properties. We changed copy too; "Software suited to your business" became "Apps for independent hotels" and "Messaging software" became "Keep in touch with your guests".</p>

    <figcaption class="article_image_caption type_caption">A collection of custom illustrations I created for the project</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="type_body">The second problem was that our users didn't think there was enough information on each product to make a final decision. The free trial was great, but it still required too much time investment to understand everything a product had to offer. We worked with both our accommodation partners and software providers to improve our product pages with a templated layout that contained a high level app summary, product demo videos, and in-depth feature information.</p>

  <p class="type_body">The "ah-ha" moment came when we asked users to proceed through the prototype and start a trial. They were confused when they landed in the software dashboard, read to use. "Where do I enter all my information?" - we explained that it would all happen automatically and would be more or less instant. The penny finally dropped when our participants realised just how easy it would be to set up new software.</p>
  <p class="type_body">To help guests understand what was happening, we slowed down our setup process and used the extra time to explain what was happening in the background. Our tests showed it helped hoteliers understand what was going on, and landing in the app made much more sense to them.</p>

  <h3 class="type_display_3 article_heading">Validate &amp; Launch</h3>
  <h2 class="type_display_2">With confidence in our concept, we decided on an MVP and worked towards launching the store</h2>

    <figcaption class="article_image_caption type_caption">The Booking.com stand at ITB Berlin, where App Store featured prominently</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="type_body">To help understand what shape our MVP would take I facilitated a prioritisation session to decide what was critical, and what could wait until later. A soft launch to a small set of users went well with users starting trials and testing new software successfully.</p>
  <p class="type_body">We developed extra features like and improved search and category pages in time for a public launch at ITB Berlin, Europe's largest travel trade show. We had thousands of hotels visiting our App Store and signing up for products. The team at the event reported users delight at how easy it was to find and try software for their business.</p>
