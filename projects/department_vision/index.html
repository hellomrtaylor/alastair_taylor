  <h1 class="type_display_1 article_title">Creating a vision for a new department at Booking.com</h1>
  <p class="type_featured">As part of a UX task force, I was given the opportunity to set a vision for a newly formed department at the heart of Booking.com’s business which included core parts of the hotel booking funnel. Whilst the content of the vision is confidential, I can share our process.</p>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">We started by holding sessions with senior stakeholders from throughout the new department. We wanted to understand their point of view, big ideas and challenges we should consider.</h2>


  <p class="type_body">The sessions were illuminating. We quickly formed an understanding of what each area was working on, jotting down insights and ideas with How Might We notes that we could refer to later.

  <p class="type_body">Due to the short timeline of the project we had no time to conduct new research. Instead we worked with user researchers to trawl through Booking.com’s research archives, working with internal and external, quantitative and qualitative research to build up an understanding of user pain points along the journey.</p>

  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">The sheer amount of information was vast. We documented individual insights and pain points in a spreadsheet, referencing the sources so we could later back up all our insights and decisions with data.</h2>

  <p class="type_body">We ran a series of workshops with Product Managers and Product Marketing Managers across the department and presented what we’d discovered from our research. Participants contributed their insights, along with short term plans for their products. This stage was key to getting buy in from teams throughout the department. This had to feel like everyone’s vision, not one made up by a small group of designers.</p>

  <p class="type_body">We now had our user journey mapped with references to supporting research and data. We now felt we had a strong understanding of customer pain points and what each area was doing to solve them. But we couldn’t simply redesign the entire user experience, that would take years. Instead, we prioritised based on scope, impact and ease of implementation. We wanted to present an achievable vision, not something that nobody could relate to.</p>
  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">Our task now was to to create a visual representation of the potential future for the department and to inspire teams to deliver the ideal guest experience. We ran three days of intensive design workshops - brainstorming ideas, crafting designs and creating stories to better communicate our concepts.</h2>

  <p class="type_body">Our final vision consisted of three stories, each representing a different type of guest, during a different stage of the journey. Accompanying them were visual concepts of the Booking.com app and what the user experience could be. Not only did this demonstrate how we could solve user problems, but also company objectives.</p>

  <p class="type_body">After presenting our vision to teams we created an internally accessible website so teams could refer to our vision, the user stories and the research and data that backed it all up. </p>

  <p class="type_body">But presenting and launching the site was only the beginning, the next phase of the project involved setting up a series of meetings with Product Managers throughout the track to discuss how we could bring this vision to life. Whilst its still early days in the life of this vision, we’re already seeing increased collaboration and teams working towards this future state.</p>
