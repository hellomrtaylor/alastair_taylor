  <p class="type_featured">At Arnold Clark, Europe’s largest independent car dealership, I led a project seeking to use technology to “roll out the red carpet” for customers. We transformed the test drive experience, increased customer satisfaction and massively increased conversion to sale.</p>

  <p class="type_body">Working with a cross functional team of developers and product managers, we conducted comprehensive research, including mystery-shopping, telephone interviews and analysed statistics from our live chat logs and customer service complaints records. I mapped out the customer journey from first curiosity through to customers driving away their new car. It didn’t take long to discover the pain points in the journey.</p>
  <h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">Our research pointed out areas such as organising an appointment to test drive a car, doing the sales paperwork and post purchase technical problems as areas for improvement</h2>
  <p class="type_body">We decided to focus on improving the experience from viewing your car online to sitting in it for a test drive as the area with the most potential for both customer and business improvement, and which didn’t come with a mountain of technical debt or legal constraints.</p>


<p class="type_body">Research revealed that the back and forth of organising an appointment to see the car of your dreams could be simplified; Previously users had to submit a request, then wait for a sales team to contact them. We quickly built an MVP booking feature on arnoldclark.com, but limited our efforts to what users could see. Each morning we sifted through a raft of emails to manually arrange appointments with branches - automating that feature would have taken far too long to test our hypothesis.</p>

<p class="type_body">Our research also pointed out that the test drive experience at each branch was inconsistent and at times impersonal. Interviewing customers had revealed that the personal touch was an important factor in them feeling comfortable when buying a car. Expanding on our appointment service, in our prototype customers would be greeted with their car parked at the entrance of the branch with a personalised sign in the window and a member of staff ready to help them out.</p>

<p class="type_body">We rolled out the feature to a limited number of branches to begin with, checking in with the sales manager after each test drive to see how it went. Our primary metric was vehicle sales but we were also interested in qualitative feedback from the team at the branch and customers. We personally emailed customers asking about thier experence. We also measured fine grained metrics like bookings completed and customers’ arrival rate to identify where improvement was needed.</p>

<h2 class="type_display_2 article_heading">Initially we only saw a small number of customers using our feature to book a test drive. However, over 50% of these users converted to sale — almost 5 times the former conversion rate</h2>

<p class="type_body">We focused on increasing the number of users interacting with the feature through a series of A/B tests. Our small changes resulted in a significant increase in online test drive reservations, as well as maintaining our high conversion rate. The team later set to work automating the manual steps and creating a roll out plan for other branches.</p>



<p class="type_body">By the end of the project our feature had a conversion rate from booking to sale of 54.8%, significantly higher than the 11.4% of the former enquiry method.</p>
